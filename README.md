#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

a branch of computer science used for developing,testing and maintaining software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Development of Capability Maturity Model-assess the maturity  of software development processes within organizations and provides framework for standardized software development processes emphasizing the importance of documentation the Emergence of 

Agile Methodologies-emerge as a response to the limitations  of traditional  software development approaches,emphasizing flexibility and continuous improvement and rapid delivery 

Thee Nato Software Engineering Conference-faces challenges by software engineering like complexity of software systems, the lack of standardization and the need for more systematic approaches to software development 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development 

Planning-identify the projects objectives and timelines

Requirement analysis- review and refine the requirements to ensure they are complete and consistent 

Design- create a detailed design document outlining the softwares components, interfaces and data structures 

Implementation - Develop the softwares code according to the design specifications 

Testing- test the integrated software system to ensure it works correctly 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be 

Waterfall Methodologies 

Testing is done at the end of the development phase

Customer feedback comes late after the product is developed 

Linear and sequential each phase is completed before moving on

Agile Methodologies 

Testing is continuous and done after ezch interaction 

Regular customer feedback is in every phase 

Interactive and incremental with multiple cycles 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer

Developing applications, programs and systems also maintaining and updating software to keep it functional 

Quality Assurance Engineer 

Create development standards and procedures for the programmes to follow 

Project Manager

Assembles and lead the software development team

Creates a blueprint for the project 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated Development Environment 

Improves productivity: a set of tools,features and plugins

Enhance code quality code editing features such as code complexion and refactoring 

Better debugging and testing : testing tools ,built debugging and fix errors 

Examples are Ecliple ,Visual Studio and Pycharm

Version Control System

Collaboration and coordination: work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts

Change tracking and auditing: provides a clear record of all changes,like who made changes,when and why

Versioning and rollback:allows developers to easily revert to previous versions of the codebase if needed 

Examples are Git ,Clearcase and Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome them

Technical Debt: insufficient testing can lead to technical debt,making it challenging to maintain and update codebase

Burnout and Exhaustion: excessive working hours can lead to burnout and exhaustion 

Communicating breakdowns: communication among team members, stakeholders amd customers can lead to misunderstandings and errors

Managing Conflicting  Priorities: juggling multiples projects and deadlines which can lead to conflicting priorities 
Strategies

Improve their overall job satisfaction 

Establish clear boundaries 

Seek support from managers amd mentors

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- involves testing individual units of code such as functions,methods or modules to ensure they work correctly
             -identify bugs ,reducing the overall cost of testing and debugging
             
  Integration -testing of how different units code work together to ensure they intergrate correctly 
            - helps to identify and fix issues that arise when different components interact with each other 
            
     System      -testing the entire software system from end to end to ensure it meetsthe required specifications and works as expected
            -helps to identify and fix issues that affect overall system including performance
            
 Acceptance testing- testing software system to meets to acceptance  criteria which is typically defined by the end users or stakeholders 
                  -helps to ensure that the software system meets the required standards and is acceptable to the end users
                  
  Importance ensures reliability:testing ensures that software system is realible 
  
  
             reduces defects:testing detects and fixes,reducing the overall defect density
             
             improves performance :testing ensures that the software  system meets users expectations 
             
             reduces costs : reduces the overall  costs of software development by detecting and fixing defects early 
                  
                 
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

The process of designing and optimizing text prompts or inputs to elicit specific,accurate and relevant responses from artificial intelligence 
improved accuracy: well crafted prompts can signify improve the accuracy of Al models responses

increased relevance: effective prompts  can help AI models provide more relevant and context- specific responses increasing their usefulness and value

Better understanding of AI model: Prompt engineering helps developers and users understand the strengths, weaknesses and limitations 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A guy and a girl are standing outside of church 
Write a story 200 words about a boy and girl standing outside  of church and they're shaking hands but the guy doesn't want to let go of the girls hand but the girl doesn't mind because she likes him amd they're both looking at each others eyes they tell each others names but when the guy leaves she jumps up and down because shes excited 
The prompt is effective because it's specifies details about what is happening outside the church and between the boy and girl,clarity the number of words which should be written  and concise because its straight to the point
